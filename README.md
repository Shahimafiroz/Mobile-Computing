| 7      | Illustration of Hidden Terminal Problem (NS-2) Consider two Wifi base stations (STA) and an access point (AP) located along the x-axis. All the nodes are fixed. The AP is situated at the middle of the two STA, the distance of separation being 150 m. [variable]. Node #0 and node #1 are the hidden terminals. Both are transmitting some data to the AP (almost at same rate) at the same time. The loss across the wireless link between each STA and the AP is fixed at 50 dB irrespective of the distance of separation. To study how RTS/CTS helps in wireless networks, 1. No RTS/CTS is being sent. 2. Nodes do exchange RTS/CTS packets. Compare the no. of packet retransmissions required in both the cases (as obtained in the output) and compare the results. |
